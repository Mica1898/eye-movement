**Title: Eye Movement**

**Description**
JavaScript based project where the the eyes follow the cursor around the screen.

**How To Run**
-Move your cursor around the screen and watch the eyes follow you
-If you are on a touchscreen device you must touch around the screen in different spots and the eyes will follow.

**Roadmap For Future Improvements**
I plan on inserting a portrait of someone and place the eyes over the image to give it a comedic effect.
